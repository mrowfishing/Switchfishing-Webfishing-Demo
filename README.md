# Switchfishing-Webfishing-Demo
Hi everyone! This is webfihsing for any modded nintendo switches!


Nintendo Switch Port
====================

The Nintendo Switch port has been built using [Homebrodot](https://github.com/Homebrodot/godot/releases/tag/3.5.3%2Bswitch%2Bvita) 

The whole demo of the game should be playable, controls have been adapted to the
Switch, it has multiplayer functionality for wich you need to host your own server
using the server executable from the [Webfishing Demo](https://lamedeveloper.itch.io/webfishing)

I excluded the text functionality as i don't know how to implement it yet sorry :.3

The default controls are:
- Up/Down/Left/Right: left joystick 
- Equip/Unequip Fishin Rod/: X button
- Deploy Fishing Rod/Wave: A button
- Sprint: B button
- Camera Right: R button
- Camera Left: L button
- Pause Menu: + button
- Silly Dance: - button
- Sitting: Down D-pad


In order to build it for Nintendo Switch, you need to dowload [Homebrodot](https://github.com/Homebrodot/godot/releases/tag/3.5.3%2Bswitch%2Bvita) wich can be found on their github or their [Discord](https://discord.gg/mYzXDke5yv)


You need to put the following files in your SD card:

The original Webfishing together with its demo has been developed by [Lamedev](https://lamedeveloper.itch.io/)

The demo has been developed for a gamejam on itchio, with a later
full release on steam, sadly no updates have been announced for a while
but i hope he is doing alright.

Please do not send any harrasment to the dev as he is super cool,
I personally loved webfishing a lot and i did this to be able to play while
also helping others play it on their nintendo switch.
